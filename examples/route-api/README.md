# File System Route API

Example site that demonstrates how to build Gatsby sites that use file-based routing APIs to create pages.

Within the pages directory you can create single-page, client-only, and dynamic collection-based routes -- all with the same simple file system API.

You can learn more in the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/file-system-page-creation/).
